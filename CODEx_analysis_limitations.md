# Codex Integration Review Status

Local repository inspection shows only two tracked files (`README.md` and this status note) and no `CRUXAGI_COMPRESSION_V2/production/codex/` directory to analyze:

```
$ ls
CODEx_analysis_limitations.md  README.md
```

Because the Codex module and expanded README requested for review are not present in this checkout, the integration cannot be documented from local sources alone. Prior attempts to synchronize with the upstream repository at `https://github.com/Dkid713/agent-forged-ai.git` failed due to blocked outbound HTTPS access in the execution environment (`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`).

Once the full repository contents are available locally—either through restored network access or a provided archive—the Codex compression module and README updates can be reviewed to produce the requested explanation of the library integration and public API behavior.
